To address this challenge, exemplified by music recommendation, we introduce the Diversified Weighted Hypergraph Recommendation algorithm (DWHRec). In DWHRec, the initial connections between users and items are modeled using a weighted hypergraph, where additional entities linked to users and items, such as artists, albums, and tags, are simultaneously integrated into the hypergraph structure. To capture users’ latent preferences, a random-walk embedding method is applied to the hypergraph. Accuracy is measured by the match between users and items, and diversity is gauged by the variety of recommended item types. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world music datasets show that DWHRec substantially outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and diversity.

This leads to a decline in performance, particularly in top-1 metrics. In response to these issues, we present a conditional denoising diffusion model that includes a stepwise diffuser, a sequence encoder, and a cross-attentive conditional denoising decoder. This approach streamlines the optimization and generation process by dividing it into simpler, more tractable sub-steps in a conditional autoregressive manner. Furthermore, we introduce a novel optimization scheme that incorporates both cross-divergence loss and contrastive loss.

Nonetheless, this persistent pursuit of accuracy frequently engenders diminished diversity, culminating in the well-recognized \"echo chamber\" phenomenon. Diversified RecSys has emerged as a countermeasure, placing diversity on par with accuracy and garnering noteworthy attention from academic circles and industry practitioners. This research explores the diversified RecSys within the intricate context of knowledge graphs (KG). These KGs act as repositories of interconnected information concerning entities and items, offering a propitious avenue to amplify recommendation diversity through the incorporation of insightful contextual information. Our contributions include introducing an innovative metric, Entity Coverage, and Relation Coverage, which effectively quantifies diversity within the KG domain. Additionally, we introduce the Diversified Embedding Learning (DEL) module, meticulously designed to formulate user representations that possess an innate awareness of diversity. In tandem with this, we introduce a novel technique named Conditional Alignment and Uniformity (CAU). It adeptly encodes KG item embeddings while preserving contextual integrity. Collectively, our contributions signify a substantial stride towards augmenting the panorama of recommendation diversity within the KG-informed RecSys paradigms.","tags":["Recommendation","Diversification"],"title":"Knowledge Graph Context-Enhanced Diversified Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingdai Yang","Zhiwei Liu","Liangwei Yang","Xiaolong Liu","Chen Wang","Hao Peng","Philip S.

On the other hand, pretraining and finetuning on the same dataset leads to a high risk of overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel multitask pretraining framework named Unified Pretraining for Recommendation via Task Hypergraphs.

However, the strict cold-start (SCS) issue, i.e., users/items have no prior interactions, poses significant challenges for RecSys. The existing methods seek to transfer content knowledge, collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge, or combine the two from the warm-start scenario towards the (strict) cold-start scenarios. However, these approaches either ignore the available information or model the information in rough manners such that the two types of knowledge interfere with each other, leading to ineffective and uncontrolled knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel dual-teacher knowledge distillation (DTKD) framework that simultaneously and effectively transfers both content and CF knowledge. The proposed DTKD framework contains two teachers, one for each knowledge type, that is specifically designed according to the characteristics of the content and CF data to distill the knowledge fully. Soft scoring is calculated during the distillation to denoise and augment the original hard-labeled interactions. A knowledge fusion module is then proposed to collect the consensus of the two teachers’ opinions. Finally, DTKD transfers both content and CF knowledge into a student module that learns the shared viewpoints of the teachers. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets under the warm-start as well as three different SCS settings (i.e., strict cold users, strict cold items, and strict cold users \u0026 items).

The proliferation of web services further expands social networks at an unprecedented scale, leading to immeasurable commercial value for online platforms. Recently, the group buying (GB) business mode is prevalent and also becoming more popular in E-commerce. GB explicitly forms groups of users with similar interests to secure better discounts from the merchants, often operating within social networks. It is a novel way to further unlock the commercial value by explicitly utilizing the online social network in E-commerce. Participant recommendation, a fundamental problem emerging together with GB, aims to find the participants for a launched group buying process with an initiator and a target item to increase the GB success rate. This paper proposes Multi-View Graph Convolution for Participant Recommendation (MVPRec) to tackle this problem. To differentiate the roles of users (Initiator/Participant) within the GB process, we explicitly reconstruct historical GB data into initiator-view and participant-view graphs. Together with the social graph, we obtain a multi-view user representation with graph encoders. Then MVPRec fuses the GB and social representation with an attention module to obtain the user representation and learns a matching score with the initiator’s social friends via a multi-head attention mechanism. Social friends with the Top-k matching score are recommended for the corresponding GB process. Experiments on three datasets justify the effectiveness of MVPRec in the emerging participant recommendation problem.

In this paper, we propose diversifying GNN-based recommender systems by directly improving the embedding generation procedure.

To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore the rich, heterogeneous relationship among items and propose a new KG-enhanced recommendation model called Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender System (MetaKRec). In particular, we focus on modeling the rich, heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and construct several collaborative Meta-KGs to explicitly depict the relatedness of the items under the guidance of meta-knowledge.  In addition to the knowledge obtained from KG, we leverage user knowledge that extracts from user preference to construct the Meta-KGs. The constructed Meta-KGs can capture the knowledge from both the knowledge graph and user preference. Furthermore. we utilize a light convolution encoder to recursively integrate the item relationship in each collaborative Meta-KGs. This scheme allows us to explicitly gather the heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and encode them into the representations of items. In addition, we propose channel attention to fuse the item and user representations from different Meta-KGs.

However, they all require centralized storage of the social links and item interactions of users, which leads to privacy concerns. Additionally, according to strict privacy protection under General Data Protection Regulation, centralized data storage may not be feasible in the future, urging a decentralized framework of social recommendation. As a result, we design a federated learning recommender system for the social recommendation task, which is rather challenging because of its heterogeneity, personalization, and privacy protection requirements.

In regard to this, researchers have developed algorithms from simple degree methods to all kinds of sophisticated approaches. However, a more robust and practical algorithm is required for the task. In this paper, we propose the EnRenew algorithm aimed to identify a set of influential nodes via information entropy. Firstly, the information entropy of each node is calculated as initial spreading ability. Then, select the node with the largest information entropy and renovate its l-length reachable nodes’ spreading ability by an attenuation factor, repeat this process until specific number of influential nodes are selected. Compared with the best state-of-the-art benchmark methods, the performance of proposed algorithm improved by 21.1%, 7.0%, 30.0%, 5.0%, 2.5%, and 9.0% in final affected scale on CEnew, Email, Hamster, Router, Condmat, and Amazon network, respectively, under the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) simulation model. The proposed algorithm measures the importance of nodes based on information entropy and selects a group of important nodes through dynamic update strategy. The impressive results on the SIR simulation model shed light on new method of node mining in complex networks for information spreading and epidemic prevention.","tags":[],"title":"Influential Nodes Identification in Complex Networks via Information Entropy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dennis Nii Ayeh Mensah","Hui Gao","Liangwei Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"1af7a687a8e4d44a115cca1f77ce79e8","permalink":"https://YangLiangwei.github.io/publication/algorithms/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/algorithms/","section":"publication","summary":"Proposed algorithms for calculating the shortest paths such as Dijikstra and Flowd-Warshall’s algorithms are limited to small networks due to computational complexity and cost.

Cancerlectins, a kind of lectins, which play a key role in the process of tumor cells interacting with each other and are being employed as therapeutic agents. A full understanding of cancerlectins is significant because it provides a tool for the future direction of cancer therapy. Objective To develop an accurate and practically useful timesaving tool to identify cancerlectins. A novel sequence-based method is proposed along with a correlative webserver to access the proposed tool. Methods Firstly, protein features were extracted in a newly feature building way termed, g-gap tripeptide composition. After which a proposed cascade linear discriminant analysis (Cascade LDA) is used to alleviate the high dimensional difficulties with the Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) as a feature importance criterion. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the classifier to identify cancerlectins. Results The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 91.34% with sensitivity of 89.89%, specificity of 92.48% and an 0.8318 Mathew’s correlation coefficient based on only 13 fusion features in jackknife cross validation, the result of which is superior to other published methods in this domain.

However, because electricity consumption data are often made up of complex and unstable series, it is very hard for a simple single method to always obtain accurate predictions. To improve electricity demand forecasting robustness and accuracy, a hybrid empirical mode decomposition and state space model are proposed, for which the empirical mode decomposition is applied to decompose the total time series (noise filtering), and the state space model is employed to forecast every sub-series (feature extraction), with the state space model parameters being optimized using maximum likelihood via a Kalman filter. Compared with autoregressive integrated moving average model and artificial neural networks, the proposed model had more stable and accurate forecasting. This method could be broadly applied to not only forecast electricity demand, being a key step for developing electricity generation plans and formulating energy policy, but also forecast any similar time series data with noise and substantive latent features, making a new step toward solving such a problem.","tags":[],"title":"Monthly Electricity Demand Forecasting using Empirical Mode Decomposition-based State Space Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhineng Hu","Jing Ma","Liangwei Yang","Xiaoping Li","Meng Pang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"af52f0afea0d58439f30e3aaed0019be","permalink":"https://YangLiangwei.github.io/publication/sustainability/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sustainability/","section":"publication","summary":"(1) Background Electricity consumption data are often made up of complex, unstable series that have different fluctuation characteristics in different industries.

(3) Results To further illustrate the prediction accuracy and stationarity of the proposed method, a comparison analysis using an analysis of variance and an orthogonal approach to solve the least squares equations was conducted using classical individual models, a combination forecasting model, and a decomposition-based combination forecasting model. The proposed method had a very satisfactory overall performance with good verification and validation compared to autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural-networks (ANN).

Phage proteins can be divided into two main categories, that is, virion and non-virion proteins with different functions. In practice, people mainly use phage virion proteins to clarify the lysis mechanism of bacterial cells and develop new antibacterial drugs. Accurate identification of phage virion proteins is therefore essential to understanding the phage lysis mechanism. Although some computational methods have been focused on identifying virion proteins, the result is not satisfying which gives more room for improvement. In this study, a new sequence-based method was proposed to identify phage virion proteins using g-gap tripeptide composition. In this approach, the protein features were firstly extracted from the ggap tripeptide composition. Subsequently, we obtained an optimal feature subset by performing incremental feature selection (IFS) with information gain. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier to discriminate virion proteins from non-virion proteins. In 10-fold crossvalidation test, our proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.40% with AUC of 0.9958, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The result reveals that our proposed method could be a promising method in the work of phage virion proteins identification.","tags":[],"title":"Identification of Phage Virion Proteins by using the g-gap Tripeptide Composition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
