Recently, the integration of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has enhanced the capability to capture semantic descriptions of items. However, while PLMs excel in few-shot, zero-shot, and unified modeling scenarios, they often overlook the crucial signals from collaborative filtering (CF), resulting in suboptimal performance when sufficient training data is available. To effectively combine semantic representations with the CF signal and enhance recommender system performance in both warm and cold settings, two major challenges must be addressed (1) bridging the gap between semantic and collaborative representation spaces, and (2) refining while preserving the integrity of semantic representations. In this paper, we introduce CARec, a novel model that adeptly integrates collaborative filtering signals with semantic representations, ensuring alignment within the semantic space while maintaining essential semantics. We present experimental results from four real-world datasets, which demonstrate significant improvements. By leveraging collaborative alignment, CARec also shows remarkable effectiveness in cold-start scenarios, achieving notable enhancements in recommendation performance.

Our investigation reveals that the benefits of GCNs are more pronounced during testing rather than training. Motivated by this, LightGODE utilizes a novel post-training graph convolution method that bypasses the computation-intensive message passing of GCNs and employs a non-parametric continuous graph ordinary-differential-equation (ODE) to dynamically model node representations. This approach drastically reduces training time while achieving fine-grained post-training graph convolution to avoid the distortion of the original training embedding space, termed the embedding discrepancy issue. We validate our model across several real-world datasets of different scales, demonstrating that LightGODE not only outperforms GCN-based models in terms of efficiency and effectiveness but also significantly mitigates the embedding discrepancy commonly associated with deeper graph convolution layers.

Moreover, CMR experiences market shifts, leading to differences in item popularity and user preferences among different markets. This study focuses on cross-market sequential recommendation (CMSR) and proposes the Cross-market Attention Transferring with Sequential Recommendation (CAT-SR) framework to address these challenges and market shifts. CAT-SR incorporates a pre-training strategy emphasizing item-item correlation, selective self-attention transferring for effective transfer learning, and query and key adapters for market-specific user preferences.

Inspired by instruction-based prompts widely used in pre-trained language models, we introduce instructions into graph pertaining. In this paper, we propose a novel pretraining framework named Instruction-based Hypergraph Pretraining. To overcome the discrepancy between pretraining and downstream tasks, text-based instructions provide explicit guidance on specific tasks for representation learning. Compared to learnable prompts, whose effectiveness depends on the quality and diversity of training data, text-based instructions intrinsically encapsulate task information and support the model's generalization beyond the structure seen during pretraining.

This leads to a decline in performance, particularly in top-1 metrics. In response to these issues, we present a conditional denoising diffusion model that includes a stepwise diffuser, a sequence encoder, and a cross-attentive conditional denoising decoder. This approach streamlines the optimization and generation process by dividing it into simpler, more tractable sub-steps in a conditional autoregressive manner. Furthermore, we introduce a novel optimization scheme that incorporates both cross-divergence loss and contrastive loss.

However, the strict cold-start (SCS) issue, i.e., users/items have no prior interactions, poses significant challenges for RecSys. The existing methods seek to transfer content knowledge, collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge, or combine the two from the warm-start scenario towards the (strict) cold-start scenarios. However, these approaches either ignore the available information or model the information in rough manners such that the two types of knowledge interfere with each other, leading to ineffective and uncontrolled knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel dual-teacher knowledge distillation (DTKD) framework that simultaneously and effectively transfers both content and CF knowledge. The proposed DTKD framework contains two teachers, one for each knowledge type, that is specifically designed according to the characteristics of the content and CF data to distill the knowledge fully. Soft scoring is calculated during the distillation to denoise and augment the original hard-labeled interactions. A knowledge fusion module is then proposed to collect the consensus of the two teachers’ opinions. Finally, DTKD transfers both content and CF knowledge into a student module that learns the shared viewpoints of the teachers. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets under the warm-start as well as three different SCS settings (i.e., strict cold users, strict cold items, and strict cold users \u0026 items).

The proliferation of web services further expands social networks at an unprecedented scale, leading to immeasurable commercial value for online platforms. Recently, the group buying (GB) business mode is prevalent and also becoming more popular in E-commerce. GB explicitly forms groups of users with similar interests to secure better discounts from the merchants, often operating within social networks. It is a novel way to further unlock the commercial value by explicitly utilizing the online social network in E-commerce. Participant recommendation, a fundamental problem emerging together with GB, aims to find the participants for a launched group buying process with an initiator and a target item to increase the GB success rate. This paper proposes Multi-View Graph Convolution for Participant Recommendation (MVPRec) to tackle this problem. To differentiate the roles of users (Initiator/Participant) within the GB process, we explicitly reconstruct historical GB data into initiator-view and participant-view graphs. Together with the social graph, we obtain a multi-view user representation with graph encoders. Then MVPRec fuses the GB and social representation with an attention module to obtain the user representation and learns a matching score with the initiator’s social friends via a multi-head attention mechanism. Social friends with the Top-k matching score are recommended for the corresponding GB process.

To cope with the data sparsity issue, we devise a novel propagation augmentation (PA) layer, which is based on our proposed factorized attention mechanism. PA layers efficiently learn the relatedness of non-neighbor nodes to improve the information propagation to users. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets verify the superiority of CFAG. Additional detailed investigations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","tags":[],"title":"Ranking-based Group Identification via Factorized Attention on Social Tripartite Graph","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liangwei Yang","Shen Wang","Jibing Gong","Shaojie Zheng","Shuying Du","Zhiwei Liu","Philip S.

Recently the literature has adopted neural graph networks (GNNs) on the collaborative knowledge graph and built an end-to-end KG-enhanced RecSys. However, the majority of these approaches have three limitations (1) treat the collaborative knowledge graph as a homogeneous graph and overlook the highly heterogeneous relationships among items, (2)lack of design to explicitly leverage the rich side information, and (3) overlook the rich knowledge in user preference. To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore the rich, heterogeneous relationship among items and propose a new KG-enhanced recommendation model called Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender System (MetaKRec). In particular, we focus on modeling the rich, heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and construct several collaborative Meta-KGs to explicitly depict the relatedness of the items under the guidance of meta-knowledge.  In addition to the knowledge obtained from KG, we leverage user knowledge that extracts from user preference to construct the Meta-KGs. The constructed Meta-KGs can capture the knowledge from both the knowledge graph and user preference. Furthermore. we utilize a light convolution encoder to recursively integrate the item relationship in each collaborative Meta-KGs. This scheme allows us to explicitly gather the heterogeneous semantic relationships among items and encode them into the representations of items. In addition, we propose channel attention to fuse the item and user representations from different Meta-KGs. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant gains over the state-of-the-art baselines on both regular and cold-start recommendation settings.","tags":[],"title":"MetaKRec: Collaborative Meta-Knowledge Enhanced Recommender System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jing Ma","Liangwei Yang","Zhineng Hu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"3630bf8401050261c0786dce6e0c8df9","permalink":"https://YangLiangwei.github.io/publication/population_research_and_policy_review/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/population_research_and_policy_review/","section":"publication","summary":"Poverty has been a long-term global challenge, and China’s Targeted Poverty Alleviation (TPA) Strategy has made considerable advances in recent years. Taking a poverty-stricken county in Southwest China as an example, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the TPA strategy using a propensity scoring weighting model for multiple non-equivalent household groups based on counterfactual inference. It was found that households who planned to be out of poverty earlier had significantly higher incomes than those later, with transfer incomes contributing substantially to the income gap. The non-poverty-stricken households had much higher total income and significantly lower transfer incomes than the poverty-stricken households, including those that planned to be out of poverty earlier and those later. A more nuanced analysis revealed that the income of the poverty-stricken households was not as sustainable as expected. Therefore, measures to improve the self-development capabilities of these poverty-stricken households were also proposed to ensure the poverty alleviation programs are more effective and sustainable.","tags":["Poverty Alleviation"],"title":"A Counterfactual Assessment of Poverty Alleviation Sustainability on Multiple Non-equivalent Household Groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Wang","Hengrui Zhang","Zhiwei Liu","Liangwei Yang","Philip S.

However, current methods suffer from the following issues 1) sparsity of user-item interactions, 2) uncertainty of sequential records, 3) long-tail items. In this paper, we propose to incorporate contrastive learning into the framework of Variational AutoEncoders to address these challenges simultaneously. Firstly, we introduce ContrastELBO, a novel training objective that extends the conventional single-view ELBO to two-view case and theoretically builds a connection between VAE and contrastive learning from a two-view perspective. Then we propose Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (ContrastVAE in short), a two-branched VAE model with contrastive regularization as an embodiment of ContrastELBO for sequential recommendation. We further introduce two simple yet effective augmentation strategies named model augmentation and variational augmentation to create a second view of a sequence and thus making contrastive learning possible. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ContrastVAE and the proposed augmentation methods.

The former can discover more potential online games of their interests, and the latter can attract users to dwell longer in the platform. This paper investigates the characteristics of user behaviors with respect to the online games on the Steam platform. Based on the observations, we argue that a satisfying recommender system for online games is able to characterize personalization, game contextualization and social connection. However, simultaneously solving all is rather challenging for game recommendation. Firstly, personalization for game recommendation requires the incorporation of the dwelling time of engaged games, which are ignored in existing methods. Secondly, game contextualization should reflect the complex and high-order properties of those relations. Last but not least, it is problematic to use social connections directly for game recommendations due to the massive noise within social connections. To this end, we propose a Social-aware Contextualized Graph Neural Recommender System (SCGRec), which harnesses three perspectives to improve game recommendation. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of users’ online game behaviors, which motivates the necessity of handling those three characteristics in the online game recommendation.","tags":[],"title":"Large-scale Personalized Video Game Recommendation via Social-aware Contextualized Graph Neural Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiwei Liu","Liangwei Yang","Ziwei Fan","Hao Peng","Philip S.

Recent developments of the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) also provide recommender systems with powerful backbones to learn embeddings from a user-item graph. However, only leveraging the user-item interactions suffers from the cold-start issue due to the difficulty in data collection. Hence, current endeavors propose fusing social information with user-item interactions to alleviate it, which is the social recommendation problem. Existing work employs GNNs to aggregate both social links and user-item interactions simultaneously. However, they all require centralized storage of the social links and item interactions of users, which leads to privacy concerns. Additionally, according to strict privacy protection under General Data Protection Regulation, centralized data storage may not be feasible in the future, urging a decentralized framework of social recommendation. As a result, we design a federated learning recommender system for the social recommendation task, which is rather challenging because of its heterogeneity, personalization, and privacy protection requirements. To this end, we devise a novel framework Fe drated So cial recommendation with G raph neural network ( FeSoG ). Firstly, FeSoG adopts relational attention and aggregation to handle heterogeneity. Secondly, FeSoG infers user embeddings using local data to retain personalization. Last but not least, the proposed model employs pseudo-labeling techniques with item sampling to protect the privacy and enhance training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets justify the effectiveness of FeSoG in completing social recommendation and privacy protection.

In this paper, we propose the EnRenew algorithm aimed to identify a set of influential nodes via information entropy. Firstly, the information entropy of each node is calculated as initial spreading ability. Then, select the node with the largest information entropy and renovate its l-length reachable nodes’ spreading ability by an attenuation factor, repeat this process until specific number of influential nodes are selected.

Accurate identification of phage virion proteins is therefore essential to understanding the phage lysis mechanism.

In this study, a new sequence-based method was proposed to identify phage virion proteins using g-gap tripeptide composition.
