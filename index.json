Taking a poverty-stricken county in Southwest China as an example, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the TPA strategy using a propensity scoring weighting model for multiple non-equivalent household groups based on counterfactual inference. It was found that households who planned to be out of poverty earlier had significantly higher incomes than those later, with transfer incomes contributing substantially to the income gap. The non-poverty-stricken households had much higher total income and significantly lower transfer incomes than the poverty-stricken households, including those that planned to be out of poverty earlier and those later. A more nuanced analysis revealed that the income of the poverty-stricken households was not as sustainable as expected. Therefore, measures to improve the self-development capabilities of these poverty-stricken households were also proposed to ensure the poverty alleviation programs are more effective and sustainable.","tags":["Poverty Alleviation"],"title":"A Counterfactual Assessment of Poverty Alleviation Sustainability on Multiple Non-equivalent Household Groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Wang","Hengrui Zhang","Zhiwei Liu","Liangwei Yang","Philip S.

However, current methods suffer from the following issues 1) sparsity of user-item interactions, 2) uncertainty of sequential records, 3) long-tail items. In this paper, we propose to incorporate contrastive learning into the framework of Variational AutoEncoders to address these challenges simultaneously. Firstly, we introduce ContrastELBO, a novel training objective that extends the conventional single-view ELBO to two-view case and theoretically builds a connection between VAE and contrastive learning from a two-view perspective. Then we propose Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (ContrastVAE in short), a two-branched VAE model with contrastive regularization as an embodiment of ContrastELBO for sequential recommendation. We further introduce two simple yet effective augmentation strategies named model augmentation and variational augmentation to create a second view of a sequence and thus making contrastive learning possible. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ContrastVAE and the proposed augmentation methods.

The former can discover more potential online games of their interests, and the latter can attract users to dwell longer in the platform. This paper investigates the characteristics of user behaviors with respect to the online games on the Steam platform. Based on the observations, we argue that a satisfying recommender system for online games is able to characterize personalization, game contextualization and social connection. However, simultaneously solving all is rather challenging for game recommendation. Firstly, personalization for game recommendation requires the incorporation of the dwelling time of engaged games, which are ignored in existing methods. Secondly, game contextualization should reflect the complex and high-order properties of those relations. Last but not least, it is problematic to use social connections directly for game recommendations due to the massive noise within social connections. To this end, we propose a Social-aware Contextualized Graph Neural Recommender System (SCGRec), which harnesses three perspectives to improve game recommendation. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of users’ online game behaviors, which motivates the necessity of handling those three characteristics in the online game recommendation.","tags":[],"title":"Large-scale Personalized Video Game Recommendation via Social-aware Contextualized Graph Neural Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiwei Liu","Liangwei Yang","Ziwei Fan","Hao Peng","Philip S.

Recent developments of the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) also provide recommender systems with powerful backbones to learn embeddings from a user-item graph. However, only leveraging the user-item interactions suffers from the cold-start issue due to the difficulty in data collection. Hence, current endeavors propose fusing social information with user-item interactions to alleviate it, which is the social recommendation problem. Existing work employs GNNs to aggregate both social links and user-item interactions simultaneously. However, they all require centralized storage of the social links and item interactions of users, which leads to privacy concerns. Additionally, according to strict privacy protection under General Data Protection Regulation, centralized data storage may not be feasible in the future, urging a decentralized framework of social recommendation. As a result, we design a federated learning recommender system for the social recommendation task, which is rather challenging because of its heterogeneity, personalization, and privacy protection requirements. To this end, we devise a novel framework Fe drated So cial recommendation with G raph neural network ( FeSoG ). Firstly, FeSoG adopts relational attention and aggregation to handle heterogeneity. Secondly, FeSoG infers user embeddings using local data to retain personalization. Last but not least, the proposed model employs pseudo-labeling techniques with item sampling to protect the privacy and enhance training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets justify the effectiveness of FeSoG in completing social recommendation and privacy protection. We are the first work proposing a federated learning framework for social recommendation to the best of our knowledge.","tags":[],"title":"Federated Social Recommendation with Graph Neural Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liangwei Yang","Zhiwei Liu","Yingtong Dou","Jing Ma","Philip S.

In regard to this, researchers have developed algorithms from simple degree methods to all kinds of sophisticated approaches. However, a more robust and practical algorithm is required for the task. In this paper, we propose the EnRenew algorithm aimed to identify a set of influential nodes via information entropy. Firstly, the information entropy of each node is calculated as initial spreading ability. Then, select the node with the largest information entropy and renovate its l-length reachable nodes’ spreading ability by an attenuation factor, repeat this process until specific number of influential nodes are selected. Compared with the best state-of-the-art benchmark methods, the performance of proposed algorithm improved by 21.1%, 7.0%, 30.0%, 5.0%, 2.5%, and 9.0% in final affected scale on CEnew, Email, Hamster, Router, Condmat, and Amazon network, respectively, under the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) simulation model. The proposed algorithm measures the importance of nodes based on information entropy and selects a group of important nodes through dynamic update strategy.

However, because electricity consumption data are often made up of complex and unstable series, it is very hard for a simple single method to always obtain accurate predictions. To improve electricity demand forecasting robustness and accuracy, a hybrid empirical mode decomposition and state space model are proposed, for which the empirical mode decomposition is applied to decompose the total time series (noise filtering), and the state space model is employed to forecast every sub-series (feature extraction), with the state space model parameters being optimized using maximum likelihood via a Kalman filter. Compared with autoregressive integrated moving average model and artificial neural networks, the proposed model had more stable and accurate forecasting.

Phage proteins can be divided into two main categories, that is, virion and non-virion proteins with different functions. In practice, people mainly use phage virion proteins to clarify the lysis mechanism of bacterial cells and develop new antibacterial drugs. Accurate identification of phage virion proteins is therefore essential to understanding the phage lysis mechanism. Although some computational methods have been focused on identifying virion proteins, the result is not satisfying which gives more room for improvement. In this study, a new sequence-based method was proposed to identify phage virion proteins using g-gap tripeptide composition. In this approach, the protein features were firstly extracted from the ggap tripeptide composition. Subsequently, we obtained an optimal feature subset by performing incremental feature selection (IFS) with information gain. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier to discriminate virion proteins from non-virion proteins. In 10-fold crossvalidation test, our proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.40% with AUC of 0.9958, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
