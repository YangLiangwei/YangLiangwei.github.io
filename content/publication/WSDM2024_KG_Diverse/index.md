abstract:  The field of Recommender Systems (RecSys) has been extensively studied to enhance accuracy by leveraging users' historical interactions. Nonetheless, this persistent pursuit of accuracy frequently engenders diminished diversity, culminating in the well-recognized "echo chamber" phenomenon. Diversified RecSys has emerged as a countermeasure, placing diversity on par with accuracy and garnering noteworthy attention from academic circles and industry practitioners. This research explores the diversified RecSys within the intricate context of knowledge graphs (KG). These KGs act as repositories of interconnected information concerning entities and items, offering a propitious avenue to amplify recommendation diversity through the incorporation of insightful contextual information. Our contributions include introducing an innovative metric, Entity Coverage, and Relation Coverage, which effectively quantifies diversity within the KG domain. Additionally, we introduce the Diversified Embedding Learning (DEL) module, meticulously designed to formulate user representations that possess an innate awareness of diversity. In tandem with this, we introduce a novel technique named Conditional Alignment and Uniformity (CAU). It adeptly encodes KG item embeddings while preserving contextual integrity. Collectively, our contributions signify a substantial stride towards augmenting the panorama of recommendation diversity within the KG-informed RecSys paradigms.
