abstract: |
 With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to perform a variety of tasks, their application in recommender systems (RecSys) has shown promise. However, we are facing significant challenges when deploying LLMs into RecSys, such as limited prompt length, unstructured item information, and un-constrained generation of recommendations, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel Taxonomy-guided Recommendation (TaxRec) framework to empower LLM with category information in a systematic approach. Specifically, TaxRec features a two-step process one-time taxonomy categorization and LLM-based recommendation. In the one-time taxonomy categorization phase, we organize and categorize items, ensuring clarity and structure of item information. In the LLM-based recommendation phase, we feed the structured items into LLM prompts, achieving efficient token utilization and controlled feature generation. This enables more accurate, contextually relevant, and zero-shot recommendations without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that TaxRec significantly enhances recommendation quality compared to traditional zero-shot approaches, showcasing its efficacy as a personal recommender with LLMs.
