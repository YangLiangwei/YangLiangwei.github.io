Glad to meet you here. Currently I am a research scientist at Salesforce Research working on efficient modeling and agents. Previously I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Illinois Chicago, under the supervision of professor Philip S. Yu. Even before, I accomplish my Master degree under the supervision of professor Hui Gao and Tao Zhou from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I am always open to learn new things, and enjoy the procedure of every task. If you are an interesting person, and enjoy your life. Welcome to contact me~
